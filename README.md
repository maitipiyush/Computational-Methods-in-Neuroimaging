Diffusion Tensor Imaging
1.Let I denote an MRI image of size 256x256x256 with an isotropic resolution of 1mm. All the
voxels are stored in the RAS orientation. Let p = (0,0,0) denote the voxel with a coordinate
(0,0,0), i.e., the lower‚Äêleft corner of the image.
 * Find out the vertex and triangle array of the mesh.
 * Use the MATLAB code ViewMesh.m to plot this mesh.
